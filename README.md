Summary of the DriverPass Project

The DriverPass project was created for a client named Liam, the owner of DriverPass, a company that helps students prepare for their driver’s license exams. The goal was to design a comprehensive web-based system that provides online practice tests, driving lesson scheduling, and progress tracking for students. The system also needed to support administrative functions for instructors, office staff, and the IT department, while integrating secure payment processing and DMV updates.

What I Did Well

I did particularly well in gathering and translating client requirements into functional and nonfunctional specifications. The business requirements document clearly outlined user roles, security needs, and scheduling workflows. I also created detailed UML diagrams that accurately represented both process and object interactions in the system, helping visualize how users, data, and system components would interact.

What I Would Revise

If I could revise one part of my work, I would improve the UML Use Case Diagram by clarifying relationships between certain functions, such as connecting the login process to user-restricted features like scheduling and progress tracking. This would better represent the security flow and access control requirements discussed in the client interview.

Interpreting and Implementing User Needs

To interpret the user’s needs, I carefully reviewed the DriverPass interview transcript to identify key pain points and desired outcomes. I then converted these into actionable system features, such as automated scheduling, online testing, and role-based access control. Considering the user’s needs is vital in system design because it ensures that the final product is intuitive, functional, and aligns with real-world business goals rather than purely technical assumptions.

Approach to Designing Software

My approach to designing software involves combining process modeling and object-oriented analysis to create a complete view of how the system functions and how its components interact. I start by gathering requirements and building use case diagrams, then move into activity, sequence, and class diagrams to refine the design. In the future, I plan to continue using iterative design, stakeholder feedback loops, and prototyping to validate design choices early and reduce costly revisions later in the development cycle.
